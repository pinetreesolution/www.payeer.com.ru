                            Freezing is an action in a result of which the User’s right to make all transactions or
                            some operations on the Platform, has been suspended.</p>
                            <p>7.2.
                            The Service Provider shall freeze the right to manage assets or to use the Service, if:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>7.2.1.

                                    settle the Service Provider’s claims against the User;</li>
                                    <li>7.2.2.
                                    the Service Provider suspects the User of connection to the money laundering,
                                    terrorism financing or other crime (e.g. fraud);</li>
                                    <li>7.2.3.
                                    the Service Provider suspects that corresponding transaction, the User or connected
                                    person is related to the territory, area of activity, the Service or a person subject to sanctions or other national transaction limits (e.g. sanctions of the European Union

                                    <li>7.2.4.
                                    a company mediating the Service (e.g. international card organisation or other
                                    settlement system operator) has established restrictions on the corresponding
                                    country, territory, currency, area of activity, Service, person or transaction (e.g.
                                    restrictions on international payments that are related to gambling or a territory
                                    linked to sanctions);</li>

                                    the Service Provider has been presented with controversial information about the
                                    persons having the right of representation or documents regarding the authenticity
                                    of which the Service Provider has doubts;</li>

                                    the User did not submit to the Service Provider documents and all the data which in
                                    the meaning of the Service Provider required to establish that submitted to the

                                    upon the estimation of the Service Provider, freezing is necessary in order to

                                    the User’s assets have been attached or there is another ground for the freezing

                            The Service Provider shall cancel the freezing as soon as the reason for freezing has
                            been eliminated.</p>
                            <p>7.4.
                            The Service Provider shall not bear liability for the damage arising from freezing.</p>
                            <p>7.5.
                            The Service Provider shall only attach the assets of the User at the request of a third

                            <p>7.6.
                            The Service Provider shall release the User’s assets from the attachment on the
                            basis of a resolution of the body that issued the attachment decision, regulation or
                            precept or on the basis of the enforced judicial decision.</p>
                            <p>7.7.
                            The Service Provider may carry out planned maintenance and development work of

                            Provider’s contractual obligations before the User arising from the User Agreement
                            shall be suspended and the Service Provider shall not compensate the User for the

                            Agreement due to the abovementioned grounds.</p>

                            The Service Provider may immediately unilaterally cancel the User Agreement for a
                            good reason (extraordinary cancellation). The good reason should be considered as

                            circumstances, the person who filed the complaint will be notified of it as well as of the
                            term during which the complaint will be replied to.</p>
