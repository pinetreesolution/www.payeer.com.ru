                        <div class="article-item" id="item-1">
                           <h3>1. Firm Policy</h3>
                            <p>It is the policy of PAYEER to prohibit and actively prevent money laundering
                           and any activity that facilitates money laundering or the funding of terrorist or criminal
                           activities by complying with all applicable requirements under the Money Laundering and
                           Terrorism (Prevention) Act, Money Laundering and Terrorism (Prevention) Act Guidelines,
                           Anti-Money Laundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) Guidelines
                           , FATF recommendations and its implementing
                           regulations.</p>

                           <p>Generally speaking, the money laundering process consists of three “stages”:

                           <p>Placement: The introduction of illegally obtained monies or other valuables into financial
                           or nonfinancial institutions.</p>

                           <p>Layering: Separating the proceeds of criminal activity from their source through the use of
                           layers of complex financial transactions. These layers are designed to hamper the audit
                           trail, disguise the origin of funds and provide anonymity.</p>

                           <p>Integration: Placing the laundered proceeds back into the economy in such a way that
                           they reenter the financial system as apparently legitimate funds.</p>

                           <p>These “stages” are not static and overlap broadly. Financial institutions may be misused
                           at any point in the money laundering process.</p>

                           <p>PAYEER is committed to the highest standards of anti-money laundering
                           (AML) compliance and requires management and employees to adhere to these
                           standards to prevent use of our products and services for money laundering purposes.
                           PAYEER will examine its Anti Money Laundering strategies, goals and
                           objectives on an ongoing basis and maintain an effective Anti-Money Laundering program
                           for the Company’s business that reflects the best practices for a diversified, global
                           financial company. Adherence to the PAYEER Anti-Money Laundering Program
                           is the responsibility of all employees. The program includes client screening and
                           monitoring requirements, “know your customer” policies (including the requirement to
                           establish the identity of beneficial owners), Embargo policies, record keeping
                           requirements, the reporting of suspicious circumstances in accordance with relevant laws,
                           and training.</p>

                           change in this information and will review, and if necessary update, this information within
                           14 business days after the end of each calendar year. The annual review of FCS
                           information will be conducted by CO and will be completed with all necessary updates
                           being provided no later than 17 business days following the end of each calendar year. In
                           addition, if there is any change to the information, CO will update the information
                           promptly, but in any event not later than 30 days following the change.</p>

                           <p>This section underlines that “Countries should ensure that Money Laundering and
                           Terrorism (Prevention) Act do not inhibit implementation of the FATF Recommendations.</p>

                           <p>Financial institutions should be prohibited from keeping anonymous accounts or
                           accounts in obviously fictitious names.</p>

                           <p>Financial institutions should be required to undertake customer due diligence (CDD)
                           measures when:</p>

                           <p>(i) establishing business relations;</p>

                           <p>(ii) carrying out occasional transactions (i) above the applicable designated threshold
                           (USD/EUR 15,000); </p>

                           <p>or (ii) that are wire transfers in the circumstances covered by the Interpretive Note to
                           Recommendation 16;</p>

                           <p>(iii) there is a suspicion of money laundering or terrorist financing; </p>

                           <p>or (iv) the financial institution has doubts about the veracity or adequacy of previously
                           obtained customer identification data. The principle that financial institutions should
                           conduct CDD should be set out in law. Each country may determine how it imposes
                           specific CDD obligations, either through law or enforceable means. The CDD measures to
                           be taken are as follows:</p>

                           <p>(a) Identifying the customer and verifying that customer’s identity using reliable,
                           independent source documents, data or information.</p>

                           <p>(b) Identifying the beneficial owner, and taking reasonable measures to verify the identity
                           of the beneficial owner, such that the financial institution is satisfied that it knows who the
                           beneficial owner is. For legal persons and arrangements this should include financial
                           institutions understanding the ownership and control structure of the customer.</p>

                           <p>(c) Understanding and, as appropriate, obtaining information on the purpose and intended nature of the business relationship.</p>

                           <p>(d) Conducting ongoing due diligence on the business relationship and scrutiny of
                           transactions undertaken throughout the course of that relationship to ensure that the
                           transactions being conducted are consistent with the institution’s knowledge of the
                           customer, their business and risk profile, including, where necessary, the source of funds.</p>
                           <p>(i) Above the applicable designated threshold (USD/EUR 15,000); or (ii) that are wire
                           transfers in the circumstances covered by the Interpretive Note to Recommendation 16;</p>

                           <p>(iii) There is a suspicion of money laundering or terrorist financing; or (iv) the financial
                           institution has doubts about the veracity or adequacy of previously obtained customer
                           identification data. The principle that financial institutions should conduct CDD should be
                           set out in law. Each country may determine how it imposes specific CDD obligations,
                           either through law or enforceable means.</p>

                           <p>The CDD measures to be taken are as follows:</p>

                           <p>(a) Identifying the customer and verifying that customer’s identity using reliable,
                           independent source documents, data or information.</p>

                           <p>(b) Identifying the beneficial owner, and taking reasonable measures to verify the identity
                           of the beneficial owner, such that the financial institution is satisfied that it knows who the
                           beneficial owner is. For legal persons and arrangements this should include financial institutions understanding the ownership Financial institutions should be required to apply each of the CDD measures under (a) to (d) above, but should determine the extent of
                           such measures using a risk-based approach (RBA) in accordance with the Interpretive
                           Notes to this Recommendation and to Recommendation 1. Financial institutions should
                           be required to verify the identity of the customer and beneficial owner before or during the
                           course of establishing a business relationship or conducting transactions for occasional
                           customers. Countries may permit financial institutions to complete the verification as
                           soon as reasonably practicable following the establishment of the relationship, where the
                           money laundering and terrorist financing risks are effectively managed and where this is
                           essential not to interrupt the normal conduct of business.</p>

                           <p>Where the financial institution is unable to comply with the applicable requirements under
                           paragraphs (a) to (d) above (subject to appropriate modification of the extent of the
                           measures on a risk-based approach), it should be required not to open the account,
                           commence business relations or perform the transaction; or should be required to
                           terminate the business relationship; and should consider making a suspicious
                           transactions report in relation to the customer. These requirements should apply to all
                           new customers, although financial institutions should also apply this recommendation to
                           existing customers on the basis of materiality and risk, and should conduct due diligence
                           on such existing relationships at appropriate times.</p>

                           <p>Financial institutions should be required to maintain, for at least seven years, all
                           necessary records on transactions, both domestic and international, to enable them to
                           comply swiftly with information requests from the competent authorities. Such records
                           must be sufficient to permit reconstruction of individual transactions (including the
                           amounts and types of currency involved, if any) so as to provide, if necessary, evidence
                           for prosecution of criminal activity. Financial institutions should be required to keep all
                           records obtained through CDD measures (e.g. copies or records of official identification
                           documents like passports, identity cards, driving licences or similar documents), account
                           files and business correspondence, including the results of any analysis undertaken (e.g.
                           inquiries to establish the background and purpose of complex, unusual large
                           transactions), for at least seven years after the business relationship is ended, or after the
                           date of the occasional transaction. Financial institutions should be required by law to
                           maintain records on transactions and information obtained through the CDD measures.
                           The CDD information and the transaction records should be available to domestic
                           competent authorities upon appropriate authority.</p>

                           <p>Financial institutions should be required to apply enhanced due diligence measures to
                           business relationships and transactions with natural and legal persons, and financial
                           institutions, from countries for which this is called for by the FATF. The type of enhanced
                           due diligence measures applied should be effective and proportionate to the risks.
                           Countries should be able to apply appropriate countermeasures when called upon to do
                           so by the FATF. Countries should also be able to apply counter measures independently
                           of any call by the FATF to do so. Such countermeasures should be effective and
                           proportionate to the risks. The above mentioned measures can also be applied to our
                           industry as per the section 22 of INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS ON COMBATING
                           MONEY LAUNDERING AND THE FINANCING OF TERRORISM & PROLIFERATION, the
                           FATF Recommendations (February 2012)</p>

                           <p>Before final approval of a client, and on an ongoing basis, CO will check to ensure that a
                           customer does not appear on the SDN list or is not engaging in transactions that are
                           prohibited by the economic sanctions and embargoes administered and enforced by OFAC. (See the OFAC Web site for the SDN list and listings of current sanctions and
                           embargoes). Because the SDN list and listings of economic sanctions and embargoes are
                           updated frequently, we will consult them on a regular basis and subscribe to receive any
                           available updates when they occur. With respect to the SDN list, we may also access that
                           list through various software programs to ensure speed and accuracy including FINRA’s
                           OFAC Search Tool that screens names against the SDN list. CO will also review existing
                           accounts against the SDN list and listings of current sanctions and embargoes when they
                           are updated and [he or she] will document the review.</p>

                           <p>If we determine that a customer is on the SDN list or is engaging in transactions that are
                           prohibited by the economic sanctions and embargoes administered and enforced by
                           OFAC, we will reject the transaction and/or block the customer's assets and file a blocked
                           assets and/or rejected transaction form with OFAC within 10 days. We will also call the
                           OFAC Hotline at (800) 540-6322 immediately. Our review will include customer corporate
                           documents,accounts, transactions involving customers (including activity that passes
                           through the firm such as wires).</p>

                           Rule 2010 (Standards of Commercial Honor and Principles of Trade) and Books and
                           Records, we have established, documented and maintained a written Customer
                           Identification Program (CIP). We will collect certain customer identification information
                           from each customer who give us assets for management, utilize risk-based measures to
                           verify the identity of each customer who opens an account; record customer identification
                           information and the verification methods and results; provide the required adequate CIP
                           notice to customers that we will seek identification information to verify their identities;
                           and compare customer identification information with government-provided lists of
                           suspected terrorists, once such lists have been issued by the government.</p>

                           <h4>a. Required Customer Information</h4>
                           <p>Prior to approving our services, CO will collect the following information for all customers,
                           if applicable, for any person, entity or organization:</p>

                           <p>(1) the name;</p>

                           <p>(2) an address, which will be a residential or business street address (for an individual), an
                           Army Post Office (APO) or Fleet Post Office (FPO) box number, or residential or business
                           street address of next of kin or another contact individual (for an individual who does not
                           have a residential or business street address), or a principal place of business, local
                           office, or other physical location (for a person other than an individual); </p>

                           <p>When adding funds with bank cards in RUB currency for less than 15 000 RUB card photo verification is not needed. 3DSecure verification is enough.</p>

                           <p>For unverified accounts withdrawal is possible for up to 999 USD per day.</p>

                           <h4>b. Customers Who Refuse to Provide Information</h4>
                           <p>If a potential or existing customer either refuses to provide the information described
                           above when requested, or appears to have intentionally provided misleading information,
                           our firm will not offer our services and, after considering the risks involved, consider
                           closing any business with the client. In either case, our AML Compliance Person will be
                           notified so that we can determine whether we should report the situation to FIU on a STR.</p>

                           <h4>c. Verifying Information</h4>
                           <p>Based on the risk, and to the extent reasonable and practicable, we will ensure that we
                           have a reasonable belief that we know the true identity of our customers by using risk-
                           based procedures to verify and document the accuracy of the information we get about
                           our customers. CO will analyze the information we obtain to determine whether the
                           information is sufficient to form a reasonable belief that we know the true identity of the
                           customer (e.g., whether the information is logical or contains inconsistencies).</p>

                           <p>We will verify customer identity through documentary means collected by us. We will use
                           documents to verify customer identity when appropriate documents are available. In light
                           of the increased instances of identity fraud, we will supplement the use of documentary
                           evidence by using the non-documentary means described below whenever necessary.
                           We may also use non-documentary means, if we are still uncertain about whether we
                           know the true identity of the customer. In verifying the information, we will consider
                           whether the identifying information that we receive, such as the customer’s name, street
                           address, zip code, telephone number (if provided), date of birth and Social Security
                           number, allow us to determine that we have a reasonable belief that we know the true
                           identity of the customer (e.g., whether the information is logical or contains
                           inconsistencies).</p>

                           <p>Appropriate documents for verifying the identity of customers include the following:<br>
                           - For an individual, an unexpired government-issued identification evidencing nationality
                           or residence and bearing a photograph or similar safeguard, such as a driver’s license or
                           passport;<br>
                           - For a person other than an individual, documents showing the existence of the entity,
                           such as certified articles of incorporation, a government-issued business license, a
                           partnership agreement or a trust instrument.
                           </p>
                           <p>We understand that we are not required to take steps to determine whether the document
                           that the customer has provided to us for identity verification has been validly issued and
                           that we may rely on a government-issued identification as verification of a customer’s
                           identity. If, however, we note that the document shows some obvious form of fraud, we
                           must consider that factor in determining whether we can form a reasonable belief that we
                           know the customer’s true identity.</p>

                           <p>
                              We will use the following non-documentary methods of verifying identity:
                              <br>
                              - Independently verifying the customer’s identity through the comparison of information
                              provided by the customer with information obtained from a consumer reporting agency,
                              public database or other;
                              <br>
                              - Checking references with other financial institutions; or

                              We will use non-documentary methods of verification when:
                              <br>
                              (1) the customer is unable to present an unexpired government-issued identification
                              document with a photograph or other similar safeguard;
                              <br>
                              (2) the firm is unfamiliar with the documents the customer presents for identification
                              verification;
                              <br>
                              (3) the customer and firm do not have face-to-face contact; and
                              <br>
                              (4) there are other circumstances that increase the risk that the firm will be unable to verify
                              the true identity of the customer through documentary means.
                           </p>
                           <h4>d. Recordkeeping</h4>
                           <p>PAYEER follows established bookkeeping and documentation standards.</p>

                           <p>We will document our verification, including all identifying information provided by a
                           customer, the methods used and results of verification, and the resolution of any
                           discrepancies identified in the verification process. We will keep records containing a
                           description of any document that we relied on to verify a customer’s identity, noting the
                           type of document, any identification number contained in the document, the place of
                           issuance, and if any, the date of issuance and expiration date. With respect to non-
                           documentary verification, we will retain documents that describe the methods and the
                           results of any measures we took to verify the identity of a customer. We will also keep
                           records containing a description of the resolution of each substantive discrepancy
                           discovered when verifying the identifying information obtained. We will retain records
                           made about verification of the customer's identity for seven years after the record is
                           made.</p>

                           <h4>e. Comparison with Government-Provided Lists of Terrorists</h4>
                           <p>At such time as we receive notice that a federal government agency has issued a list of
                           known or suspected terrorists and identified the list as a list for CIP purposes, we will,
                           within a reasonable period of time after entering into an agreement (or earlier, if required
                           by another federal law or regulation or federal directive issued in connection with an
                           applicable list), determine whether a customer appears on any such list of known or
                           suspected terrorists or terrorist organizations issued by any federal government agency
                           and designated as such by Treasury in consultation with the federal functional regulators.
                           We will follow all directives issued in connection with such lists.</p>

                           <p>We will continue to comply separately with OFAC rules prohibiting transactions with
                           certain foreign countries or their nationals.</p>

                           <h4>f. Notice to Customers</h4>
                           <p>We will provide notice to customers that the firm is requesting information from them to
                           verify their identities, as required by law. We will use the following method to provide
                           notice to customers: Email, Phone call or certified mail.</p>

                           any customer that is entering into an agreement or similar business relationship with the
                           other financial institution to provide or engage in services, dealings or other financial
                           transactions:
                           <br>
                           - when such reliance is reasonable under the circumstances;
                           <br>
                           - when the other financial institution is subject to a rule implementing the anti-money
                           laundering compliance program requirements, and is regulated by a federal functional
                           regulator; and
                           <br>
                           - when the other financial institution has entered into a contract with our firm requiring it
                           to certify annually to us that it has implemented its anti-money laundering program and
                           that it will perform (or its agent will perform) specified requirements of the customer
                           identification program.

                           <p>When an employee of the firm detects any red flag, or other activity that may be
                           suspicious, he or she will notify. Under the direction of the AML Compliance Person, the
                           firm will determine whether or not and how to further investigate the matter. This may
                           include gathering additional information internally or from third-party sources, contacting
                           the government, freezing the account and/or filing a STR.</p>

                           <h3>9. Suspicious Transactions and BSA Reporting</h3>
                           <h4>a. Filing a STR</h4>
                           <p>TEXT EXAMPLE: We will file STR with FIU for any transactions (including deposits and
                           transfers) conducted or attempted by, at or through our firm involving $15,000 or more of
                           funds or assets (either individually or in the aggregate) where we know, suspect or have
                           reason to suspect:</p>

                           <p>(1) the transaction involves funds derived from illegal activity or is intended or conducted
                           in order to hide or disguise funds or assets derived from illegal activity as part of a plan to violate or evade federal law or regulation or to avoid any transaction reporting
                           requirement under federal law or regulation;</p>

                           <p>(2) the transaction is designed, whether through structuring or otherwise, to evade any
                           requirements of the IFSC regulations;</p>

                           <p>(3) the transaction has no business or apparent lawful purpose or is not the sort in which
                           the customer would normally be expected to engage, and after examining the
                           background, possible purpose of the transaction and other facts, we know of no
                           reasonable explanation for the transaction; or</p>

                           <p>(4) the transaction involves the use of the firm to facilitate criminal activity.</p>

                           <p>We will also file a STR and notify the appropriate law enforcement authority in situations
                           involving violations that require immediate attention, such as terrorist financing or ongoing
                           money laundering schemes.</p>

                           <p>We will report suspicious transactions by completing a STR, and we will collect and
                           maintain supporting documentation as required by the IFSC and FIU regulations. We will
                           file a STR no later than 30 calendar days after the date of the initial detection of the facts
                           that constitute a basis for filing a STR. If no suspect is identified on the date of initial
                           detection, we may delay filing the STR for an additional 30 calendar days pending
                           identification of a suspect, but in no case will the reporting be delayed more than 60
                           calendar days after the date of initial detection. The phrase “initial detection” does not
                           mean the moment a transaction is highlighted for review. A review must be initiated
                           promptly upon identification of unusual activity that warrants investigation.</p>

                           <p>We will retain copies of any STR filed and the original or business record equivalent of any
                           supporting documentation for five years from the date of filing the STR. We will identify
                           and maintain supporting documentation and make such information available to FIU, any
                           other appropriate law enforcement agencies, federal or state securities regulators.</p>

                           <p>We will not notify any person involved in the transaction that the transaction has been
                           reported, except as permitted by the IFSC and FIU regulations. We understand that
                           anyone who is subpoenaed or required to disclose a STR or the information contained in
                           the STR will, except where disclosure is requested by FIU, or another appropriate law
                           enforcement or regulatory agency, or to provide any information that would disclose that
                           a STR was prepared or filed. We will notify IFSC or FIU, or of any such request and our
                           response.</p>

                           <h4>b. Currency Transaction Reports</h4>
                           <p>Our firm prohibits transactions involving currency and has the following procedures to
                           prevent such transactions: Paying from other peoples bank accounts or credit cards. If
                           we discover such transactions have occurred, we will file with FIU for currency
                           transactions that exceed $10,000. Also, we will treat multiple transactions involving
                           currency as a single transaction for purposes of determining whether to file a STR if they
                           total more than $10,000 and are made by or on behalf of the same person during any one
                           business day.</p>

                           <h4>a. Responsibility for Required AML Records and STR Filing</h4>
                           <p>Our AML Compliance Person and his or her designee will be responsible for ensuring that
                           AML records are maintained properly and that STR is filed as required.</p>

                           <p>In addition, as part of our AML program, our firm will create and maintain FIU, IFSC and
                           relevant documentation on customer identity and verification and funds transmittals. We
                           will maintain FIU and their accompanying documentation for at least seven years. We will
                           keep other documents according to existing laws and other recordkeeping requirements.</p>

                           <h4>b. SAR-SF Maintenance and Confidentiality</h4>
                           <p>We will hold STR and any supporting documentation confidential. We will not inform
                           anyone outside of FIU, or other appropriate law enforcement or regulatory agency about a
                           STR. We will refuse any subpoena requests for FIU or for information that would disclose
                           that a STR has been prepared or filed and immediately notify FIU, FinCEN of any such
                           subpoena requests that we receive. We will segregate STR filings and copies of
                           supporting documentation from other firm books and records to avoid disclosing STR
                           filings. Our AML Compliance Person will handle all subpoenas or other requests for FIU.
                           We may share information with another financial institution about suspicious transactions.</p>

                           <p>We shall retain either the original or a microfilm or other copy or reproduction of each of

                           Person and senior management. Our training will occur on at least an annual basis. It will
                           be based on our firm’s size, its customer base, and its resources and be updated as
                           necessary to reflect any new developments in the law.</p>

                           <p>Our training will include, at a minimum: (1) how to identify red flags and signs of money
                           laundering that arise during the course of the employees’ duties; (2) what to do once the
                           risk is identified (including how, when and to whom to escalate unusual customer activity
                           or other red flags for analysis and, where appropriate, the filing of FIU; (3) what
                           employees' roles are in the firm's compliance efforts and how to perform them; (4) the
                           firm's record retention policy; and (5) the disciplinary consequences (including civil and

                           memos. We will maintain records to show the persons trained, the dates of training and
                           the subject matter of their training.</p>

                           <p>We will review our operations to see if certain employees, such as those in compliance,
                           margin and corporate security, require specialized additional training. Our written
                           procedures will be updated to reflect any such changes.</p>
